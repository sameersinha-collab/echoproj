	Characters
	CINDERELLA (21)
 Quietly strong and observant. Speaks with thoughtfulness. Finds her voice in a world that constantly overlooks her.
PRINCE LEO (22)
 Curious, kind, and emotionally aware. Longs for honesty in a palace full of performance. Forms a connection with Cinderella based on respect and reflection.
PEBBLE (age unknown)
 A cheeky squirrel with a big heart. Often sarcastic, always loyal. Slightly more grounded than Tuff.
TUFF (age unknown)
 A fast-talking, dramatic sparrow. Bold, clever, emotional. Thinks he's the hero of the story. Hilarious.
MADAM GERTRUDE (50s)
 Controlling and proud. Obsessed with appearances. Uses scolding to mask her fear of fading influence.
OLGA (17)
 Dramatic, fashion-forward, and self-centered. Desperate for admiration. Constantly feuding with Bertha.
BERTHA (16)
 Awkward, loud, and always in Olga’s shadow. Tries to stand out, but often makes things worse. Clumsy but endearing.
FAIRY GODMOTHER (Ageless)
 Mysterious, poetic, and calm. Appears only when truly needed. Offers truth, not tricks — and never wastes words.
KING BRAMBLE (60s)
 Loud, formal, and fixated on legacy. Cares deeply, but rarely shows it well. Thinks emotions are dangerous in public.
QUEEN ELENA (50s)
 Soft-spoken, thoughtful, and wise. Speaks rarely but meaningfully. Understands Leo better than anyone.
PRINCE LEO (22)
 [Already listed above, repeated here for palace grouping.]
SIR HECTOR GREY (50s) – Royal Advisor
 Smart, strategic, and slightly overwhelmed. Manages palace logistics and tries to steer the king away from chaos. Always carrying scrolls.
CAPTAIN WILLOUGHBY (40s) – Head of the Royal Guard
 Formal, upright, and deeply sincere. Takes orders very literally. Doesn’t always understand metaphors or social nuance.
ROYAL MESSENGER (30s)
 Lives for dramatic delivery. Believes his announcements are events unto themselves. Possibly owns multiple trumpets.
LADY BLISSWICK (40s)
 A pushy noblewoman desperate to secure a match between her daughters and Prince Leo. Comic relief. Appears briefly at the ball.

CHAPTER 1: Dust and Dishes
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Once upon a time, in a house that was never quiet, there lived a girl named Cinderella. Upstairs, two sisters argued about ribbons and boots. Downstairs, their mother gave orders about nearly everything. And in between it all… was Cinderella. She swept the floors. She scrubbed the pots. She folded laundry that wasn’t hers, fetched things she didn’t use, and smiled at people who rarely looked at her. She did all the work… and none of the shouting. Her only company? A squirrel named Pebble… and a sparrow named Tuff. They were loyal and very, very loud for their size.
CINDERELLA
Dishes, done. Floor, mostly clean. Mood? Somewhere between tired… and don’t ask. Still breathing. Still here.
PEBBLE
You forgot “hero of the kitchen,” “queen of the broom,” and “mopper of invisible dust.”
TUFF
And all before breakfast! I’d give you a medal, but I ate it. It was chocolate. I regret nothing.
CINDERELLA
I had half a crust of bread. Possibly from yesterday.
PEBBLE
Ah. The royal feast continues. Aged to perfection.
TUFF
Aged, cracked, and possibly haunted.
CINDERELLA
We should start a cookbook: “One Crumb, Infinite Recipes.”
PEBBLE
Chapter One: Pretend It’s Cake.
TUFF
Chapter Two: Cry On It For Seasoning.
CINDERELLA
Chapter Three: Add hope and stir.
OLGA (O.S.)
Cinderella! My brush is missing and I’m going to melt down in three… two… one!
BERTHA (O.S.)
She was helping me first! I need her for my boots!
CINDERELLA
Wonderful. I’ve been double-booked. Possibly triple. Do I get a bell to ring when I fall apart?
GERTRUDE
Still dawdling, are we? Olga’s hair looks like a bird’s nest. Bertha’s cloak is a disgrace. And the front steps are filthy. I want everything spotless before tea. Not almost. Not nearly. Spotless.
CINDERELLA
Yes, Madam Gertrude.
GERTRUDE
And stop talking to woodland creatures. It’s unsettling. You sound... unhinged.
PEBBLE
She’s just jealous of my tail. And your cheekbones.
TUFF
And my sparkling wit. I should host a ball. Or a podcast.
CINDERELLA
You two are the only reason I haven’t turned into a mop with feelings.
PEBBLE
Correction: a very stylish mop.
TUFF
With strong opinions on crumbs.
CINDERELLA
Fine. I’m going. Olga’s hair won’t puff itself. But first—hold this ribbon.
PEBBLE
Got it! Wait—what does one do with a ribbon?
TUFF
I think you flap it dramatically and yell “Victory!”
PEBBLE
Nope. I tied myself to the candlestick. Help.
TUFF
I told you. Use your tail, not your face.
CINDERELLA
Honestly, you're both worse than Bertha’s boots.
PEBBLE
I take that as a compliment.
TUFF
Boots are reliable.
CINDERELLA
You two would follow me, wouldn’t you? Even if I ran far, far away?
PEBBLE
Of course. I’m excellent at travel. Very agile. Also adorable. It helps.
TUFF
And I fly. So I’ll scout the road ahead. You’ll never walk alone.
CINDERELLA
Sometimes I think about it. Not forever. Just… One quiet day. No orders. No shouting. Just sky. And wind. And maybe the sound of trees that don’t complain.
PEBBLE
Trees are good listeners. I approve.
TUFF
And they don’t throw boots.
CINDERELLA
You two would turn a peaceful day into a parade.
PEBBLE
Parade? No. More like a tasteful procession. With [a]banners.
TUFF
And glitter. Don’t forget glitter.
CINDERELLA
Still… I like that thought. One day. One little day for me.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Later, when no one was looking, Cinderella crouched near the hearth and gathered the last of the ash into a pan. Her fingers left smudges on the tile. Her name had come from these ashes. "Cinder"-ella. A girl named after what clung to the edges and never stayed clean.
CINDERELLA
Funny, isn’t it? Even the name stuck like soot.
PEBBLE
Not funny. Legendary. You rose out of ash and still remembered how to be kind.
TUFF
You deserve a better nickname. Like “Ella the Mighty.”
CINDERELLA
Or “Ella, Survivor of Stew Night.”
PEBBLE
Catchy.
CINDERELLA
Maybe someday… I won’t live in the edges. I’ll stand right in the middle. And they’ll have to see me.
PEBBLE
They’ll need sunglasses.
TUFF
We’ll start designing your crest.
CINDERELLA
Thank you. For talking to me like I matter.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Cinderella didn’t have jewels. Or gowns. Or magic. But she had two noisy friends… A quiet strength… And just enough hope to get through the day. And sometimes… that’s where the story begins.
CHAPTER 2: “THE ROYAL INVITATION”
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 The next morning, the sky was clear, the wind was sharp, and something unusual was about to arrive at the front door. Cinderella was already sweeping, Pebble was doing acorn inventory on the windowsill, and Tuff was halfway through his third opinion of the day.
CINDERELLA
 Broom—check. Dustpan—check. Slight feeling that today will be just like every other day—also check.
PEBBLE
 Incorrect. I predict medium chaos by midmorning.
TUFF
 Chaos? Please. I’m sensing… royal-level disaster.
CINDERELLA
 What does that even mean?
TUFF
 It means someone very fancy is about to ruin our peace and quiet.
PEBBLEo
 Too late. Here comes the bell.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 And sure enough… there it was. A sharp knock. Then another. Then a trumpet.
MESSENGER (O.S., CALLING OUT)
 By royal order! His Highness Prince Leo invites every household to a grand ball at the palace! One night only! Dresses encouraged! Dancing expected!
CINDERELLA
 A ball?
TUFF
 Called it.
PEBBLE
 You didn’t say “ball.” You said “disaster.”
TUFF
 Same thing, just with snacks.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Madam Gertrude didn’t waste a second. Within moments, she and the sisters were flying down the stairs like overstuffed teapots.
GERTRUDE
 A royal ball! Girls! We must begin preparations immediately! Olga, fetch the green gown! Bertha, polish your shoes!
OLGA
 Mother, I need my gold earrings!
BERTHA
 Mother, I need a new face!
GERTRUDE
 Cinderella! Tea! And thread! And extra pins! We’re going to the palace!
CINDERELLA
 Yes, Madam.
PEBBLE
 You know… you could go too.
CINDERELLA
 Don’t be ridiculous.
TUFF
 You’re not ridiculous. You’re just surrounded by people who are.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Cinderella paused. Just for a second. Just long enough to picture it—her, in a gown, walking through glowing halls. Music. Lanterns. The sound of her own footsteps not leading toward a chore.
CINDERELLA
 I don’t belong in a palace. Not in real life.
PEBBLE
 Says who?
CINDERELLA
 The people who’d laugh if I showed up.
TUFF
 Then we laugh louder. In style.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Upstairs, the noise grew louder than ever. There were ruffles flying and ribbons flying and at least one small bottle of perfume flying. Cinderella, as usual, was doing everything—except getting ready herself.
CINDERELLA
 Hold still, Olga, your hairbrush is tangled.
OLGA
 It’s your fault! You made my hair angry!
BERTHA
 Cinderella, my shoes won’t button! Why are they so small?
CINDERELLA
 Because you’re wearing Olga’s.
BERTHA
 Oh. I knew they felt weird.
GERTRUDE
 Cinderella, get down to the kitchen and find my pearl brooch!
PEBBLE
 You know what I’d do?
CINDERELLA
 Throw socks?
PEBBLE
 Yes. And maybe a shoe. And yell something powerful like “Down with ruffles!”
TUFF
 And then we’d all go to the ball with style.
CINDERELLA
 I don’t even have a dress.
TUFF
 You have spirit.
PEBBLE
 You have kindness.
TUFF
 And very good cheekbones.
CINDERELLA (smiling)
 You two are ridiculous.
GERTRUDE (O.S.)
 Cinderella! Stop whispering to the windows and get those pins!
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 But even as she smiled, Cinderella felt something small stirring—something she hadn’t felt in a long time. The tiniest hope. That maybe… just maybe… she might go to the ball too.
PEBBLE
 You want to go. Don’t pretend you don’t.
CINDERELLA
 Wanting and having aren’t the same thing.
TUFF
 But wanting is where it starts.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 As she darted from room to room—measuring hems, fetching shawls, tying ribbons—something shifted. She didn’t say it out loud. Not yet. But part of her… had begun to wonder: What if?
GERTRUDE
 And no strange behavior tonight! I don’t want the neighbors thinking you’re clever or worse—hopeful.
CINDERELLA
 No, Madam.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 She tucked away her thoughts, along with the last pin and the final thread. The house spun in circles around her, preparing for a party she wasn’t meant to attend.
PEBBLE
 We’ll find a way. Mark my whiskers.
TUFF
 And my wing. One night. One chance. That’s all it takes.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 The invitation had arrived. The gowns were chosen. The sisters were nearly ready. And somewhere, beneath a pile of ribbons and routine… a question waited. Would she go?




CHAPTER 3: “THE GARDEN AND THE WISH” 
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 That evening, the house was anything but quiet. Olga was panicking about her earrings. Bertha was stuck inside her own dress. Madam Gertrude was barking orders faster than a marching drum. And in the middle of it all… stood Cinderella.
GERTRUDE
 Olga! Bertha! Stand up straight! You look like wrinkled laundry! Cinderella! Where is my fan?
CINDERELLA
 You're holding it.
GERTRUDE
 I knew that! Bring my perfume!
OLGA
 I can't find my second shoe!
BERTHA
 My dress won't zip! Cinderella—zip me! No, wait—don’t zip me!
CINDERELLA
 Try breathing first.
PEBBLE
 This is better than a squirrel soap opera.
TUFF
 I give it five stars for chaos.
OLGA
 Mother, my hair looks flat!
BERTHA
 Mother, my necklace is choking me!
GERTRUDE
 Cinderella! Where is the invitation? Where is my handkerchief?
CINDERELLA
 Invitation—on the table. Handkerchief—tucked in your sleeve.
GERTRUDE
 Yes, of course. I’m a genius. Everyone ready?
BERTHA
 No!
OLGA
 Yes!
TUFF
 This is going great.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 At last, after one final swirl of perfume and shouting, the door slammed behind them. And the carriage rolled down the lane. And for the first time in hours… the house was still.
CINDERELLA
 Well. That was exhausting.
PEBBLE
 Do we get a snack now?
TUFF
 I need a nap just from watching. And maybe a glass of water and a motivational speech.
CINDERELLA
 You two rest. I think I’ll step outside.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 She walked into the garden. Slowly. Like the ground might give way. The wind had settled, and the air smelled of lavender and evening. She sat beside the garden wall, near the pumpkins, and listened to the silence.
CINDERELLA
 They didn’t even ask. Not once. Just assumed I’d stay behind and iron sleeves. I don’t want a crown. I just want to be seen.
PEBBLE
 We see you.
TUFF
 Every eyelash. Every sigh. You’re the bravest featherless creature we know.
CINDERELLA
 I help them shine… and still, I’m invisible.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Then, for the briefest moment, a wild thought lit up her heart.
CINDERELLA
 What if I just… went? Took the long road, climbed the hill, walked right up to those palace doors?
TUFF
 In these shoes?
PEBBLE
 With that hair?
CINDERELLA
 Laugh all you want. But maybe—just maybe—I could sneak in. Watch from the shadows. Hear the music. Just for a little while.
PEBBLE
 Cousin Thistle tried that once. Wanted to see the royal acorn vault. Got caught by a raccoon with a whistle.
TUFF
 We’re not letting you get captured by guards. Or raccoons.
CINDERELLA
 Fine. It was a silly idea anyway.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 But it wasn’t silly. It was honest. And honesty, even whispered to the wind, has a way of being heard.
CINDERELLA
 One night. Just one night to wear something soft. To walk into a room and not be asked for anything. That’s not selfish, is it?
PEBBLE
 It’s brave.
TUFF
 And overdue.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 She reached down and touched the earth. Soft, cool soil. The garden didn’t demand. It didn’t shout. It simply listened.
CINDERELLA
 But who would ever choose me?
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Then, just beyond the pumpkin patch, the air shifted. Like a curtain rising. And a shimmer began to glow—silver and strange and warm.
FAIRY GODMOTHER
 Even the moon gets lonely sometimes. Good evening, dear one.
TUFF
 AHH! Glowing lady!
PEBBLE
 Definitely magical. And possibly hovering.
CINDERELLA
 Who… are you?
FAIRY GODMOTHER
 Your fairy godmother. I heard a wish. A deep one. The kind that starts in silence and ends in stars.
CINDERELLA
 Why me?
FAIRY GODMOTHER
 Because you asked. Not with words. But with hope. That’s the kind of wish that finds me.
CINDERELLA
 But I’m not... royal. I’m not anything.
FAIRY GODMOTHER
 You are everything. You just haven’t worn the right shoes yet.
CINDERELLA
 I can’t go to a palace. I have nothing to wear. I’ve never danced.
FAIRY GODMOTHER
 Let me worry about that. You’ve done more than enough.
CINDERELLA
 But… what if I don’t belong?
FAIRY GODMOTHER
 The ball is just a place. Belonging lives in your bones. And it’s been waiting to shine.
PEBBLE
 I’m tearing up. Are you tearing up?
TUFF
 I’m mostly panicking but yes, also tearing up.
FAIRY GODMOTHER
 So. Do you still want to go?
CINDERELLA
 Yes.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 She didn’t shout. She didn’t twirl. She simply said yes. And the garden held its breath. And the magic began.












CHAPTER 4: “THE BALL”
NARRATOR (V.O.) 
First came a flicker… like moonlight touching water. Then a golden swirl, curling out from the pumpkin near the fence— stretching, glowing, shifting—until it stood as a shining carriage.
FAIRY GODMOTHER 
Not bad, for a vegetable.
TUFF
That thing was in our compost pile an hour ago.
PEBBLE 
Now it’s a ride fit for a queen. Not bad at all.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Next, the mice from the corner squeaked in surprise— before rising onto two legs, paws becoming hooves, tails vanishing into polished coats. Four gleaming horses stood where crumbs had been.
FAIRY GODMOTHER 
Now. A driver—ah! That sleepy lizard on the rock will do nicely.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
With a yawn and a flash, even he was transformed— top hat and all.
CINDERELLA 
It’s beautiful.
FAIRY GODMOTHER 
Not yet. Now we dress the girl.
NARRATOR (V.O.) 
The wind picked up. The air shimmered. And Cinderella’s worn dress lifted—fluttered—and melted into silver and pale blue. A gown spun from starlight and soft sky. And on her feet—two glass slippers. Clear as water. Strong as hope.
PEBBLE 
She looks… wow.
TUFF
She looks like she’s about to change her whole life.
FAIRY GODMOTHER 
One last thing— Midnight. When the clock strikes twelve, everything fades. Carriage, horses, dress, shoes—poof. So mind the time. But forget nothing.
CINDERELLA 
Forget nothing?
FAIRY GODMOTHER 
You’re not going to pretend. You’re going to remember what it feels like to be seen. To be exactly enough.
CINDERELLA 
Thank you.
FAIRY GODMOTHER 
No need. You did the wishing. I just answered the call.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And off she went. Through the town, under lanterns swinging in the breeze—to a palace lit like a dream.
SFX: ROYAL FANFARE, VIOLINS, GLASSES CLINKING, PEOPLE CHATTERING
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Inside the ballroom… was chaos.
KING BRAMBLE 
Where is he?! The entire ball is for him and he’s… late!
SIR HECTOR GREY 
He is mingling, Your Majesty. Socially. With people.
KING BRAMBLE 
People are exhausting. That’s why I invented advisors.
QUEEN ELENA 
You didn’t invent anything, Bramble.
LADY BLISSWICK (interrupting loudly)
Your Majesties! My daughter, Maribelle, is ready to be a princess and an asset to the kingdom. She also plays the harp. Sort of.
KING BRAMBLE 
We’ve got harps.
QUEEN ELENA 
What we don’t have is Leo.
NARRATOR (V.O.) 
But then… the doors opened.
PEBBLE 
Ohhh. She made an entrance.
TUFF 
If anyone blinks, I will personally squawk at them.
NARRATOR (V.O.) 
Cinderella stepped into the light. Heads turned. Fans froze. Even the chandeliers seemed to lean in.
LEO 
Excuse me… do I know you?
CINDERELLA 
Not yet.
LEO
Do you want to?
PEBBLE 
They’re doing it. The dramatic-but-tender-stare moment!
TUFF 
It’s like poetry with eyeballs.
CINDERELLA
Everyone here keeps talking about shoes and titles and pudding. You haven’t mentioned any of those.
LEO 
I’m still deciding whether I want to stay.
CINDERELLA 
Fair enough.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
They didn’t rush to dance. They wandered. Talked. They stepped out onto the balcony for a moment of quiet, away from velvet and gossip.

FAIRY GODMOTHER 
(V.O.) Midnight, dear one.[b]
SFX: CLOCK BEGINS TO CHIME — BONG… BONG…
CINDERELLA
Oh no.
LEO 
What’s wrong?
CINDERELLA 
I’m sorry. I have to go.
LEO 
But I don’t even know your name—
CINDERELLA 
Thank you… for not pretending.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
She ran. Down the steps. Through the courtyard.
SFX: GLASS SLIPPER SLIPS OFF ON STONE
NARRATOR (V.O.) 
And behind her, a single glass slipper shone in the moonlight… As the palace watched her disappear.
KING BRAMBLE 
She’s gone! Who was that girl?
CAPTAIN WILLOUGHBY 
One shoe retrieved, sire!
SIR HECTOR GREY 
We’ll question every shoe merchant in the land.
LADY BLISSWICK 
I shall now present Maribelle’s foot.
SIR HECTOR GREY 
Let him breathe, will you?
LEO 
She didn’t tell me her name. But I’ll find her.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
The music played on. The chandeliers sparkled. But a quiet had settled— The kind that comes just before something new begins.
FAIRY GODMOTHER (V.O.) 
The magic fades, yes. But the spark stays.
CHAPTER 5: “WHISPERS AND WONDERS”
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Morning came like it always did—through cracked shutters, over dusty floorboards, and into the heart of a kitchen that smelled like burnt toast and someone else’s perfume.
But this morning… something felt different.
CINDERELLA
 Tea’s hot. Bread’s warm. Laundry’s done. And I’m still… me.
PEBBLE 
Correction: you’re you… plus a sparkling secret!
TUFF 
Tell us everything! What was it like? Did you eat? Was there cheese?
CINDERELLA 
There was music. Laughter. A balcony. He listened. That’s what I remember most. He actually listened.
PEBBLE 
He didn’t talk about cloaks? Or coins? Or whose cousin married which count?
CINDERELLA 
No. Just… thoughts. And silences that didn’t need to be filled.
TUFF
 That sounds almost romantic.
CINDERELLA 
He asked questions. Real ones. Not about chores or gowns or bloodlines. Just… about me.
PEBBLE 
(softly) That’s how you know it mattered.
TUFF 
And did you dance?
CINDERELLA
Only once. But it felt like the whole night folded into that one song.
PEBBLE
 Did you spin? You must have spun. A good dance always has a spin.
TUFF
 And a dip! Was there a dip? I live for dips.
CINDERELLA (laughing)
 There was a spin. No dip. But there was… a moment.
He looked at me like… like he actually saw me. Not the dress. Not the magic. Just—me.
A pause. Pebble stands tall on the table and clears his throat.
PEBBLE
 Ladies, gentlemen, and feathered co-hosts…
Tonight, we present: The Grand Ballroom Reenactment!
Starring: Me, as Prince Leo.
TUFF
 Outrageous. I am Prince Leo.
You’re the cheese tray. Or perhaps a dramatic side chair.
PEBBLE
 Rude! Fine, I’ll be the chandelier. I’m great at dangling.
CINDERELLA
 You’re both ridiculous.
PEBBLE (dangling from a spoon)
 Music, maestro!
TUFF (twirls on a napkin)
 Oh fair lady, may I have this dance?
PEBBLE
 You’re stepping on my tail!
TUFF
 That’s how Prince Leo expresses affection!
CINDERELLA
 This is the worst reenactment I’ve ever seen.
PEBBLE
 Then you direct it!
CINDERELLA (giggling)
 Okay, okay. Scene one: The Grand Entrance.
TUFF (hushed)
 The chandeliers lean in. The music hushes.
PEBBLE
 The mystery girl arrives—gliding, glowing, and slightly confused by the shoe rules.
CINDERELLA
 And somehow… all the noise falls away. And it’s just two people.
Talking. Listening. Like… the rest of the world is on pause.
A beat. Then a soft silence.
TUFF (gently)
 You still feel it, don’t you?
CINDERELLA
 It’s like… the memory isn’t just mine. It belongs to something bigger.
To who I’m becoming.
PEBBLE (breaking it)
 That’s beautiful. And deeply moving.
Now I request a snack break and a nap.
TUFF
 And a new spoon. Mine’s emotionally overwhelmed.
PEBBLE 
Ugh. Romantic. I’ll allow it.
TUFF
More than that—it was legendary.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Upstairs, the shrieking had already begun.
OLGA (O.S.)
It’s not fair! Everyone said she was the most graceful!
BERTHA (O.S.)
I tripped once! ONCE! People act like I knocked over the queen!
GERTRUDE (O.S.)
Girls, enough! We must focus. That girl—whoever she was—left an impression.
OLGA
She looked expensive.
BERTHA 
She sparkled like a chandelier! I heard even the prince forgot how to speak.
GERTRUDE 
Then we shall study her. Copy her. Become her.
PEBBLE (mock whisper)
By all means. Become moonlight and manners and kindness. Should be easy.
TUFF 
They don’t even know it was you. This is the greatest drama of the century.
CINDERELLA 
Let them guess. Let them talk. The night was mine. That’s enough.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 At the breakfast table, Olga was sketching hairdos on a napkin. Bertha was sniffing her own elbow to test perfumes. Gertrude paced like a general before battle.
GERTRUDE 
Who was she? Where did she come from? Did anyone see her carriage? Was it gold? Silver? Floating?
OLGA 
I bet she had a stylist. And a tiara.
BERTHA
 I bet she had fake eyelashes.
GERTRUDE
 Whatever it was—she’s the reason the prince didn’t look at either of you! We must be… unforgettable.
CINDERELLA
 Second breakfast is ready.
GERTRUDE
Don’t speak unless spoken to.
PEBBLE 
Charming.
TUFF
 So royal.
OLGA 
What if she was from another kingdom?
BERTHA 
What if she was invisible?
GERTRUDE 
Nonsense. She was clever. Beautiful. Probably well-fed.
PEBBLE 
Unlike some of us.
TUFF 
Speak for yourself—I ate a corner of the napkin.
NARRATOR (V.O.) 
Cinderella moved through the kitchen like always—quiet, quick, unnoticed. But inside her chest… a secret spark danced.
CINDERELLA
 Last night… I wasn’t invisible. I was the beginning of a story.
PEBBLE 
And maybe it’s not over.
TUFF 
Maybe it’s just the first chapter.
CINDERELLA 
(softly) If he finds me… I’ll know it’s because he saw the real me. Not the dress. Not the shoes. Just me.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 She slipped away for a moment, out the side door and into the garden. There, beside the rose bush, she touched the soft petal of a bloom barely open.
CINDERELLA 
I didn’t dream it. I was there. I was the girl in the glass slippers. And no one can take that away.
PEBBLE 
Even if they never know… you know.
TUFF 
And so do we.
CINDERELLA (smiling)
 I’ll carry it. Not as a secret… but as a promise.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 And upstairs, in a swirl of perfumes and pillow fights, the sisters planned their next move.
OLGA 
I’ll dye my hair gold.
BERTHA 
I’ll walk only on tiptoes. Graceful, right?
GERTRUDE
 No one rests until we outshine that mystery girl. We will be ready when the prince returns.
OLGA
 Returns? What if he’s already out looking?
BERTHA
What if he’s nearby right now?
GERTRUDE
 Then you two better start practicing how to smile and look humble at the same time.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 But down in the kitchen… a quiet girl with flour on her hands was already shining in her own way.
And far beyond the town gates… someone with a glass slipper was getting closer.

FAIRY GODMOTHER (V.O.)
 Some magic lingers longer than a night. Especially the kind that’s true.
CHAPTER 6: “BEFORE THE KNOCK”[c]


NARRATOR (V.O.)
 The slipper was on its way.
Not just the glass one, but the truth it carried—
a truth that would reach Cinderella’s door before long.
But the house didn’t know that yet.
It just… stirred.
CINDERELLA
 You’d think a magical night would make the morning brighter.
PEBBLE
 Or at least quieter.
Even the teapot looks nervous.
TUFF
 I heard three knocks already this morning.
One was a bird.
One was a stick.
And one… might’ve been destiny.
CINDERELLA
 Let’s not talk about destiny.
I’m trying to have a normal breakfast.
PEBBLE
 You danced with the prince.
CINDERELLA
 And then ran away from him.
Classic fairytale girl behavior.
TUFF
 Classic brave girl behavior.
CINDERELLA
 They’ll come here. Won’t they?
With the slipper? Unless they accidentally try it on a goat again.
TUFF
 That goat had excellent arches.
CINDERELLA
 I’m scared.
PEBBLE
 Of what?
CINDERELLA
 Of being seen.
Really seen.
And then… not being believed.
TUFF
 Can I tell you something totally foolish?
CINDERELLA
 Always.
TUFF
 I think if someone doesn’t believe you…
it says more about them than about you.
PEBBLE
 And if they do believe you—
Well, then your next chapter begins.
CINDERELLA
 But what if they want the girl from the ball…
and not the girl from the kitchen?
PEBBLE
 You are the girl from the ball.
And the girl from the kitchen.
And the girl who saved Bertha’s boot from the fire, remember?
TUFF
 Layers, darling. You’ve got layers.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Outside, the wind picked up.
The village stirred.
And somewhere, not far away, a slipper sat in velvet… waiting.
CINDERELLA
 I didn’t wear a crown.
I didn’t make a speech.
But for one night… I felt like me.
OLD WOMAN
 Morning, child.
You’re glowing like someone with a secret.
CINDERELLA (blushing)
 Just sunlight, I suppose.
OLD WOMAN
 Mm.
Funny how light always knows where to land.
TUFF (O.S.)
 That woman had wise energy.
Possibly magical.
PEBBLE (O.S.)
 Possibly nosy.
CINDERELLA
 Possibly right.
PEBBLE
 That… wasn’t a stick.
TUFF
 Or a goat.
CINDERELLA (softly)
 It’s time.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 And so the morning ended.
And everything else… began.
CHAPTER 7: “THE SLIPPER FITS”
NARRATOR (V.O.) The moment the slipper touched the marble floor, everything changed. Not because it was magic. But because the room… went absolutely mad.
GERTRUDE 
Quick! Olga! Sit up straight! Smile like your future depends on it—which it does!
OLGA 
(fluffing hair) This is it, Bertha. My moment. I was born for this slipper.
BERTHA (shoving her) 
You were born clumsy. Move aside. I’m going first.
SIR HECTOR GREY (wearily) 
Let the record show we are now entering Phase Two: Denial by Foot.
FOOTMAN (kneeling)
 Presenting the slipper.
NARRATOR (V.O.) 
First came Olga.She lunged, she grunted, she even tried buttering her toes.
OLGA (gritting teeth)
 I think… it’s... almost... there!
FOOTMAN (concerned) 
Ma’am, your foot is turning a shade I’ve never seen.
GERTRUDE 
Keep going! Beauty is pain!

ERTRUDE (V.O.)
Keep going! Beauty is pain!
PRINCE LEO (V.O.)
And oxygen is helpful.
OLGA (V.O.)
Maybe if I wear thinner socks!
FOOTMAN (V.O.)
You’re not wearing socks, ma’am.
TUFF (V.O.)
Her toes are crying for help.
PEBBLE (V.O.)
This feels illegal.
OLGA (V.O.)
I’ll soak it in tea! Or olive oil! Or mayonnaise!
FOOTMAN (V.O.)
We do not recommend condiments for shoe fittings.
SIR HECTOR GREY (V.O.)
Moving on.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Next came Bertha.
She stormed the slipper like it owed her money.
BERTHA (V.O.)
I have royal ankles! This was meant for me!
FOOTMAN (V.O.)
It’s not meant for anyone but—
BERTHA (V.O.)
I WILL BECOME THE SHOE.
TUFF (V.O.)
If she gets it on, the shoe might sue for damages.
PEBBLE (V.O.)
I’m scared for the slipper’s structural integrity.
PRINCE LEO (V.O.)
Why is it making that squeaking noise?
FOOTMAN (V.O.)
That’s… her.
BERTHA (V.O.)
Just need more time! And maybe a hammer!
SIR HECTOR GREY (V.O.)
Note: excessive force applied. Slipper integrity: compromised. Dignity: absent.
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
Wait! One last chance!
Perhaps… perhaps it was ME all along!
TUFF (V.O.)
Oh no.
PEBBLE (V.O.)
Oh YES. I’ve been waiting for this.
FOOTMAN (V.O.)
Madam, the Prince’s request was for the one who left the ball.
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
I did! Briefly! In spirit!
PRINCE LEO (V.O.)
I... don’t believe I saw you there.
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
Well, I was wearing... a hat. A very large hat. It blocked the moonlight.
SIR HECTOR GREY (V.O.)
Note: witness now claiming lunar obstruction.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And before anyone could object—
She snatched the slipper and crammed her foot in sideways.
SFX: AGGRESSIVE SQUISH. RIP. POP.
FOOTMAN (V.O.)
Madam! That is not how—
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
It fits! Look! It fits! If you squint!
SIR HECTOR GREY (V.O.)
Correction: Foot visibly spilling out the sides. Toes may be dislocated.
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
Then what if…
I made my own slipper? Exactly the same! No one would ever know!
NARRATOR (V.O.)
From under the table, she produced a replica.
Cardboard. Glitter. Possibly glue.
TUFF (V.O.)
Is that... a cereal box?
PEBBLE (V.O.)
She’s lost it. Officially.
FOOTMAN (V.O.)
The Prince seeks the original slipper.
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
What does “original” really mean, hmm?
PRINCE LEO (V.O.)
Is there anyone else here?
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
Certainly not!
PEBBLE (V.O.)
AHEM.
TUFF (V.O.)
The broom girl’s got a secret…
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
Traitors!
FOOTMAN (V.O.)
May we search the rest of the home?
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
There’s no one here but dust and drudgery!
NARRATOR (V.O.)
But then—
A sound.
Soft. Sure.
Footsteps.
From the kitchen…
She stepped forward.
PEBBLE (V.O.)
Here we go.
TUFF (V.O.)
Hold your breath.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Her apron was dusty.
Her hands floury.
But her eyes—her eyes held starlight.
CINDERELLA (V.O.)
May I try it on?
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
No, you may not!
PRINCE LEO (V.O.)
Yes.
She may.
BERTHA (V.O.)
She wasn’t even at the ball!
TUFF (V.O.)
You sure about that?
OLGA (V.O.)
This is absurd! She’s—what is she?
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
A scullery girl! A chimney crawler! A pot scrubber!
CINDERELLA (V.O.)
And someone who remembers how to be kind.
FOOTMAN (V.O.)
Step forward, miss.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
She didn’t push. She didn’t plead.
She bent gracefully.
And slid the slipper on—
As if it had been waiting.
SFX: A CHIME. A HUSHED GASP.
OLGA (V.O.)
No.
BERTHA (V.O.)
Unacceptable!
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
She tricked it! She used… toe magic!
SIR HECTOR GREY (V.O.)
Toe magic is not an accredited field.
FOOTMAN (V.O.)
It fits.
PRINCE LEO (V.O.)
I knew it was you.
CINDERELLA (V.O.)
I almost didn’t come forward.
PRINCE LEO (V.O.)
Why?
CINDERELLA (V.O.)
Because I didn’t think anyone would believe in me.
PEBBLE (V.O.)
But she did.
TUFF (V.O.)
And that made all the difference.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Time seemed to hold its breath.
The stepsisters stared as if willing the slipper to fall off.
But it didn’t.
It simply stayed.
Perfect. Calm. Certain.
PRINCE LEO (V.O.)
Will you walk with me?
CINDERELLA (V.O.)
I’m not used to people asking.
PRINCE LEO (V.O.)
Then get used to it.
Please?
CINDERELLA (V.O.) (softly)
 Yes.
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
But she has no lineage! No fortune! No table manners!
SIR HECTOR GREY (V.O.)
Ma’am, she just curtsied so gracefully, the curtains applauded.
GERTRUDE (V.O.)
This cannot stand!
PEBBLE (V.O.)
Someone should tell her she’s sitting.
TUFF (V.O.)
Yeah, flat on her pride.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And as the door opened wide—
Cinderella stepped into a world that finally saw her.
Not a servant. Not a shadow.
But herself.
FOOTMAN (V.O.)
The carriage awaits.
BERTHA (V.O.)
I’ll never forgive that slipper.
OLGA (V.O.)
Maybe we can start a petition.
TUFF (V.O.)
Or learn to be nice.
PEBBLE (V.O.)
Woah. Radical idea.
PRINCE LEO (V.O.)
Will you be my partner in what comes next?
CINDERELLA (V.O.)
I can’t promise perfection.
PRINCE LEO (V.O.)
Just promise you’ll keep walking beside me.
CINDERELLA (V.O.)
Deal.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
She wasn’t running anymore.
She was arriving.
Fully. Bravely. Joyfully.
SIR HECTOR GREY (V.O.)
Final entry: Slipper located. Identity confirmed.
Dignity of shoe: restored.
PEBBLE (V.O.)
Do you think she gets a crown?
TUFF (V.O.)
I just want a pudding.
PEBBLE (V.O.)
I want a title! Like “Knight of the Crumbs.”
TUFF (V.O.)
We could be royal advisors! Snack division.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And somewhere, far from spells and glass and gowns…
Two hearts began something entirely their own.
CINDERELLA (V.O.) (soft)
 Thank you for seeing me.
PRINCE LEO (V.O.) (smiling)
 I think… I always did.
SFX: CARRIAGE BELLS. MUSIC RISES.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And that, dear listener, is how a story ends…
…and begins again.
Because sometimes a slipper fits, not just the foot—
But the life waiting to be lived.
CHAPTER 8: THE WEDDING DAY[d]
CHAPTER 8:The proposal& the party
LEO (kneeling on the grass)
Cinderella. Will you stay?
Not as a servant. Not as a symbol.
But as my partner.
As yourself.
CINDERELLA (after a long breath)
Yes.
PEBBLE (from the hedge)
Did she say yes?!
TUFF (swooping above)
SHE SAID YES!
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And just like that, the kingdom leaned in.
Not to marvel at a fairy tale.
But to witness a choice.
One that would soon become a celebration.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Preparations spun like ribbon in the wind.
The palace breathed with life, color, and purpose.
And at the heart of it—Cinderella.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 She moved through the kitchens with sleeves rolled and a mind ticking through details.
She tasted stew, stirred sauces, and taught the royal chef how to balance spice and sweetness.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Leo dashed between gardens and courtyards, helping children tie paper ribbons, lifting toddlers onto his shoulders, listening to laughter fill the air.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Queen Elena paced through the music hall, guiding string quartets and flute trios until each note hummed with gentle joy.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 In a corner of the palace lawn, Pebble held a whistle and paced in front of six palace mice.
PEBBLE
 No folds, no feast! Again—diagonally, not diagonally-ish!
TUFF
 I need more harmony from the sparrows. You’re not singing worm songs—we’re welcoming royalty!
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Bakers rolled dough with cinnamon and cardamom.
Children painted signs that read “Joy lives here” and “No cheese left behind.”
Councilors rehearsed their ceremonial speech...and forgot half of it.
COUNCILOR WINTON
 Is it “By the light of her courage” or “In the strength of her kindness”?
COUNCILOR MEREWELL
 Both sound vaguely poetic. Just don’t stammer this time.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Earlier that morning, Cinderella had taken a different walk—Not to the ballroom. Not to the rose garden.But beyond the gates.
VILLAGER #1 (startled)  
You're… inviting us?
CINDERELLA  
If I’m to celebrate my beginning… I want the people who helped shape it to be there.
VILLAGER #2  
You mended my fence last winter.
CINDERELLA (smiling)  
Then you’ve already done your part.
EXT. WOODSHOP – MOMENTS LATER  
A small boy hands Cinderella a crooked wooden spoon.
LITTLE BOY  
It’s crooked. But Mama says love isn’t straight anyway.
CINDERELLA (laughs)  
Your mama is very wise.
INT. PALACE – PRIVATE ROOM – LATER THAT DAY  
Cinderella stands beside Queen Elena. They’re looking at a shelf of old portraits.
CINDERELLA  
Do they all look like they belonged?
QUEEN ELENA  
They do in the paintings.  
But in real life? They forgot their speeches. Tripped on the steps. Second-guessed their hearts.  
Just like you.
CINDERELLA (quietly)  
I still feel like someone’s going to tap my shoulder and ask me to clean the fireplace.
QUEEN ELENA  
Then you turn around and smile. And tell them: “Not today.”
(A pause.)
CINDERELLA  
Do you think I’m ready?
QUEEN ELENA  
No.  
And that’s exactly why you are.
PEBBLE  
Okay—positions! The crumb aisle must be clear. The mouse ushers must not panic. And nobody—nobody—drops the acorn cake.
TUFF  
I have personally composed a three-part harmony for our entrance. It includes interpretive wing gestures.
PEBBLE (sighs)  
Why did I agree to this?
TUFF  
Because you love me.
PEBBLE  
Ugh. Unfortunately true.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 And Cinderella—barefoot for a moment, in the rose garden—taught little girls how to braid flower crowns.
CINDERELLA
 Pull gently, like you’re asking the flower to trust you.
GIRL #1
 Do queens make their own crowns?
CINDERELLA
 They do when they want them to mean something.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Then—
A snap. A spark. A squirrel with curious paws lit a sparkler two hours early.
SFX: Tiny firework pop, startled squawk.
TUFF
 Evacuate the peonies!
PEBBLE
 Fireworks are after dessert, not during garland hour!
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Even chaos had its charm that day.
As the sun dipped, lanterns floated upward, catching the wind like silent prayers.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 Pebble wore a tiny sash of royal napkin.
Tuff strutted in a crown of woven feathers and wild pride.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 From the tower balconies to the garden benches, from noble guests to village families—everyone watched the palace glow.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
 And in a window lit by quiet candlelight, Cinderella stood at the mirror.
Not a girl in rags.
Not a maid.
But herself—shining, steady, a storm stilled into grace.
QUEEN ELENA (V.O.)
 It's strange, isn't it?
How the quietest soul… can echo through every heart.
PRINCE LEO
Is it strange that I’m nervous?
QUEEN ELENA
Not at all. You’re marrying a whirlwind. A kind, stubborn, remarkable whirlwind.
PRINCE LEO (smiling)
I wouldn’t have it any other way.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Morning came like music.
Palace halls buzzed. Someone lost the veil. A mouse tangled in ribbon. The vows were misplaced and found under a teacup.
Tuff gave Pebble a bowtie pep talk. Pebble gave Tuff a feather comb.
Children shrieked with laughter. A squirrel nearly rolled down a bannister in a cake tin.
Villagers walked toward the palace with baskets and flowers. Musicians played along the way. Laughter filled the air.
VILLAGER #1
Never thought I’d be invited to a royal wedding.
VILLAGER #2
Never thought I’d want to be.
VILLAGER #3
She helped mend our roof. That’s more than any royal’s ever done.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
The palace glowed with lanterns.
The air smelled of cinnamon, lavender, and something sweetly new.
It smelled like change.
Evening settled in the palace. In the quiet green room, Cinderella looked at her companions with nervous excitement.
CINDERELLA (to Pebble and Tuff)
You ready?
PEBBLE
Born ready.
TUFF (sniffling)
I polished my feathers. I’m emotional and fabulous.
QUEEN ELENA (entering, gently adjusting Cinderella’s veil)
You’ve done more than change the palace, dear one. You’ve lit it up.
CINDERELLA (quietly)
Do you think… they’ll remember me? Not as a story, but… a person?
QUEEN ELENA
I already do.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
The courtyard shimmered under lantern light. Cinderella stepped forward, her gown sky-colored and stitched with stars. Children scattered petals before her. Behind her, Pebble and Tuff followed, proud as princes.
No jewels. No crowns. Just grace.
Just a girl… becoming something more.
PRINCE LEO (quietly)
You look like hope.
CINDERELLA
You look like someone I’d choose again.
MINISTER
Do you promise to choose one another—not once, but every day?
To listen when it’s hard, to grow when it’s easier not to, to stand together when the wind changes?
LEO & CINDERELLA
We do.
PEBBLE
Does this mean cake now?
TUFF (tearing up)
No one warned me about my emotions!
KING BRAMBLE (yelling from his seat)
Where’s the cheese?
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Villagers and nobles danced under lanterns. Music and laughter filled the air. Tables overflowed with food. Children chased fireflies. Elderly couples swayed gently. Even a few mice wore tiny hats.
COUNCILOR MEREWELL (smiling as he dances)
Mildly charming… actually very charming.
CINDERELLA (sipping tea with Leo under a tree)
Did we do it?
LEO
We did. Together.
CINDERELLA (V.O.)
This isn’t the end of my story.
It’s just a new chapter.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And oh, what a beautiful one it would be.


THE END
